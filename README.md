This repository contains the core docs for metagen-related
projects.

It is built with a forked version of mdbook. Once the
mdbook project finishes its current refactoring, The customizations
will be made again to the new versions and PRs made.

For now, the forked version of mdbook is simply a quick-n-dirty
set of mods that allow for diagrams, etc.

The fork lives at: https://github.com/jshook/mdbook.
The gh-pages are hosted from the docs subdirectory, and published
via the publish.sh script. Make sure that the forked mdbook
is in your bin path.

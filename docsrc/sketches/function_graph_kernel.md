title: Function Graph Kernel Overview
weight: 36
---

This is the first section of a multi-part design sketch. The other parts are:

- [Function Graph Primitives](../function_graph_kernel_primitives)
- [Function Graph Kernel API](../function_graph_kernel_api)
- [Function Graph Kernel Concepts](../function_graph_kernel_concepts)
- [Function Graph Kernel Scratch](../function_graph_kernel_scratch)

A function graph kernel is a runtime object which provides a state and evaluation
services to a client runtime. It encodes relationships between input values,
functions, and output values in a way that makes it efficient and ergonomic
for developers to use advanced function graph features.

Relative Cardinality
====================

This section will discuss cardinality. Also, specific terms will
be asserted that may ease discussion and elaboration in other places.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality. The purpose of this section
is to make sure that the user has a strong understanding of the notion
of relative cardinality in the context of dataset modeling.

The cardinality of a set of data is simply the number of elements contained within it. What is often more meaningful for modeling
 a problem domain is the relative cardinality between different
 types of elements. This is often called simply "the cardinalty of X",
 with an implied context of "with respect to Y". It is easier
 to capture and model a dataset with explicit relative cardinalities.
 In other words, it is better to say that "the cardinality of X is n
 with for each member of Y".
 

 
For example, suppose you are modeling a set of users and their
 purchases. The

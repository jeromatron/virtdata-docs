# The Brief History of Metagen

Metagen began as an experiment to see if a DSL could be used
to make generation of rich and nuanced test data easy.

The first generation of the metagener experiment was generally
successful in producing a working prototype, with a direct
generator specification language, fluent DSL and built-in examples.

However, it had at least one major failing: It was still not easy to use.

The current generation of metagen exists as a reboot of the original
ideas, but with a less ambitious set of goals and a focus providing
something useful. If it is successful, then some of the more
interesting features of the original idea may be added in.

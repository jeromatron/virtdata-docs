# A Brief History of VirtualDataSet

VirtualDataSet began as an experiment to see if a DSL could be used
to make generation of rich and nuanced test data easy.

The first generation of the experiment, named **Metagener**, was
generally successful in producing a working prototype, with a direct
generator specification language, fluent DSL and built-in examples. However, it had at least one major failing: It was still not easy to use.

The current version of the toolkit exists as a reboot of the original
ideas, but with a less ambitious set of goals and a focus providing
something useful. 

The design priorities of this phase of the virtual dataset tools are:

1. Java-idiomatic library support
2. Late-binding and easy integration for runtime extensions
3. Consumer-friendly APIs for easy client integration
4. A set of common recipe examples for users top copy and paste
5. Useful documentation

Once these basic goals are met, some of the more interesting features of the original project may be added in.

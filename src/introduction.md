## Projects

### metagen-java

The primary project is [metagen-java](https://github.com/virtualdataset/metagen-java).
This is a java library that makes it easy to create and consume streams of procedurally generated data. Features of metagen-java include:


Still, not enough has been done yet to make metagen-java really simple to use.
